## ICA - Independent Component Analysis

Requires independent but not necessarily orthogonal data.

Statistical independence:
P(A, B) = P(A)P(B)

Kurtosis - measuref of gaussianity:
Kurtosis = 0 -> gaussian
Kurtosis = large -> non-gaussian

In lecture notes, x1 and x2 are assumed flattened

Steps:

1 - Find the axis of maximum variance
2 -
