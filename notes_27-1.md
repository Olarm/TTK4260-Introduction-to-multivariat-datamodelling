LS - Least squares estimator
MVU - Minimum-variance unbiased estimator
MAP - Maximum a posteriori estimation
MSE - Mean Squared Error


k-folding, cross-validation k times. Validate the estimator on a random subset of the dataset k times.

LOO-CV Leave One Out Cross Validation, Computationally heavy, better statistics then k-folding

Checking system for linearity, use steps or square wave input. If the system is linear the output will be symmetric

Overfitting is associated with to much bias

Underfitting is associated with to high variance
