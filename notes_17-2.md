## Finish up model validation

### What is MAP from a mathematical perspective

### Cross Validation

Do not use random CV, use a method that preserves the natural grouping


### Data analysis workflow
Slide 27


Jackknifing is practically cross-validation
Bootstrapping is a more sophisticated strategy then Jackknifing
Jackknifing is a bit more conservatice, filters out random variables more
Bootstrapping may have a higher bias.
Bootstrapping is resampling with replacement
Jackknifing, take 1 item out of a single fold, and measure all the remaining to compare difference.
Jackknifing for smaller samples.
Bootstrapping for larger samples.
